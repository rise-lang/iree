# any non-test targets specified.
# We use `bazel query //...` piped to `bazel test` rather than the simpler
# `bazel test //...` because the latter excludes targets tagged "manual". The
# "manual" tag allows targets to be excluded from human wildcard builds, but we
# want them built by CI unless they are excluded with "nokokoro".
