# Getting Started on Linux with CMake

This guide walks through building the core compiler and runtime parts of IREE
from source. Auxiliary components like the Python bindings and Vulkan driver are
documented separately, as they require further setup.

## Prerequisites

### Install CMake

IREE uses CMake version `>= 3.13`. First try installing via your distribution's
package manager and verify the version:

```shell
$ sudo apt install cmake
$ cmake --version # >= 3.13
```

Some package managers (like `apt`) distribute old versions of cmake. If your
package manager installs a version `< 3.13`, then follow the installation
instructions [here](https://cmake.org/install/) to install a newer version (e.g.
the latest).

> Tip:<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your editor of choice likely has plugins for CMake,
> such as the Visual Studio Code
> [CMake Tools](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools) extension.

### Install Ninja

[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) is a fast build system that you can use as a
CMake generator. Follow Ninja's
[installing documentation](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages).

### Install a Compiler

We recommend Clang. GCC is not fully supported.

```shell
$ sudo apt install clang
```

## Clone and Build

### Clone

Clone the repository and initialize its submodules:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/google/iree.git
$ cd iree
$ git submodule update --init
```

> Tip:<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Editors and other programs can also clone the
> repository, just make sure that they initialize the submodules.

### Build

Configure:

```shell
$ cmake -G Ninja -B build/ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ .
```

> Tip:<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root
> [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/google/iree/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt)
> file has options for configuring which parts of the project to enable.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are further documented in [CMake Options and Variables](cmake_options_and_variables.md).

Build all targets:

```shell
$ cmake --build build/
```

## What's next?

### Take a Look Around

Check out the contents of the 'tools' build directory:

```shell
$ ls build/iree/tools
$ ./build/iree/tools/iree-translate --help
```

Translate a
[MLIR file](https://github.com/google/iree/blob/main/iree/tools/test/simple.mlir)
and execute a function in the compiled module:

```shell
$ ./build/iree/tools/iree-run-mlir $PWD/iree/tools/test/simple.mlir \
    -input-value="i32=-2" -iree-hal-target-backends=vmla -print-mlir
```
