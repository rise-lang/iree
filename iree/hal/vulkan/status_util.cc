      // command execution may fail and cause resources and backing memory to
      // become undefined.
      //
      // Typical reasons for device loss will include things like execution
      // timing out (to prevent denial of service), power management events,
      // platform resource management, or implementation errors.
      //
      // When this happens, certain commands will return
      // VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST (see Error Codes for a list of such
      // commands). After any such event, the logical device is considered lost.
      // It is not possible to reset the logical device to a non-lost state,
      // however the lost state is specific to a logical device (VkDevice), and
      // the corresponding physical device (VkPhysicalDevice) may be otherwise
      // unaffected.
      //
      // In some cases, the physical device may also be lost, and attempting to
      // create a new logical device will fail, returning VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
      // This is usually indicative of a problem with the underlying
      // implementation, or its connection to the host. If the physical device
      // has not been lost, and a new logical device is successfully created
      // from that physical device, it must be in the non-lost state.
      //
      // Whilst logical device loss may be recoverable, in the case of physical
      // device loss, it is unlikely that an application will be able to recover
      // unless additional, unaffected physical devices exist on the system. The
      // error is largely informational and intended only to inform the user
      // that a platform issue has occurred, and should be investigated further.
      // For example, underlying hardware may have developed a fault or become
      // physically disconnected from the rest of the system. In many cases,
      // physical device loss may cause other more serious issues such as the
      // operating system crashing; in which case it may not be reported via the
      // Vulkan API.
      //
      // Undefined behavior caused by an application error may cause a device to
      // become lost. However, such undefined behavior may also cause
      // unrecoverable damage to the process, and it is then not guaranteed that
      // the API objects, including the VkPhysicalDevice or the VkInstance are
      // still valid or that the error is recoverable.
      //
      // When a device is lost, its child objects are not implicitly destroyed
      // and their handles are still valid. Those objects must still be
      // destroyed before their parents or the device can be destroyed (see the
      // Object Lifetime section). The host address space corresponding to
      // device memory mapped using vkMapMemory is still valid, and host memory
      // accesses to these mapped regions are still valid, but the contents are
      // undefined. It is still legal to call any API command on the device and
      // child objects.
      //
      // Once a device is lost, command execution may fail, and commands that
      // return a VkResult may return VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
      // Commands that do not allow run-time errors must still operate correctly
      // for valid usage and, if applicable, return valid data.

      // vkDeviceWaitIdle, vkQueueWaitIdle, vkWaitForFences with a maximum
      // timeout, and vkGetQueryPoolResults with the VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT
      // bit set in flags) must return in finite time even in the case
      // of a lost device, and return either VK_SUCCESS or
      // VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST. For any command that may return
      // VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST, for the purpose of determining whether a
      // command buffer is in the pending state, or whether resources are
